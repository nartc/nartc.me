[Signals](https://angular.io/guide/signals) has been in developer-preview for more than 6 months now and the [Angular](https://angular.io) team is working hard to get the APIs to a stable release.
The community has also started working on Signals APIs. For example, [NgRx](https://ngrx.io) has put out [`selectSignal()`](https://dev.to/ngrx/announcing-ngrx-v16-integration-with-angular-signals-functional-effects-standalone-schematics-and-more-5gk6) and [`signalStore()`](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/discussions/3796#discussioncomment-6262094).
This means that in the (near) future, we'll be seeing Signals more and more in Angular projects.
And as this blog post suggests, it's time to see how we can start working towards **Signal-friendly APIs**.

> Before you read this one, please check out [Abstract `inject()` the right way](./inject-function-the-right-way) because we'll be using the concept mentioned in that blog post.

**DISCLAIMER**: This is not a comparison with [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) in terms of designing reactive APIs. This blog post main focus
is to discuss an idea of designing reactive APIs in a Signal-first scenario.

## The example

Our example is going to be a 3D Model component that can load and display various models from [Cars 3](https://movies.disney.com/cars-3).

> Our models are all `.glb` files which is a type of [gLTF File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlTF)

The gist of the example is:

-   There is a GLTF service that loads the external models
-   The service reacts to the model name via `Input`

## RxJS Approach

In an RxJS world, we can write our Component as follow:

```ts
@Component({})
export class CarModel {
    #modelName$ = new BehaviorSubject<AvailableModel>("lightning");
    @Input() set modelName(value: AvailableModel) {
        this.#modelName$.next(value);
    }

    #service = inject(GLTFService);

    model$ = this.#modelName$.pipe(
        switchMap((modelName) => this.#service.load(`assets/${modelName}.glb`)),
    ); // Observable<GLTF>

    // then next step is: model$ | async or toSignal(this.model$)
}
```

This approach is 100% correct and straight-forward. However, we want to achieve the same level of reactivity
with `Signal` because most Angular APIs (view queries, content queries, inputs etc.) are coming as `Signal` via Signal-based Component.
And people are probably going to utilize those. For example, Signal Input:

```ts
export class CarModel {
    // compare
    #modelName$ = new BehaviorSubject<AvailableModel>("lightning");
    @Input() set modelName(value: AvailableModel) {
        this.#modelName$.next(value);
    }

    // with
    modelName = input<AvailableModel>("lightning");
}
```

## Signal approach

Before we dive into a `Signal` implementation, let's quickly look at how we would want the consumers to use our Signal-friendly API for GLTF.
After building so many libraries for Angular, I realized that mocking out what you'd personally use as a consumer is super important.

Pseudo-code might look like the following:

```ts
gltf = injectGLTF(modelName);
```

I personally think that a **Custom Inject Function (CIF)** would be the most concise API for this. If we want to make `injectGLTF` Signal-friendly,
then we need the following requirements:

```ts
//                  ðŸ‘‡ this needs to be reqctive - a Signal
gltf = injectGLTF(modelName);
// ðŸ‘† this needs to be reactive - a Signal
```

Now, we can map that to our `CarModel` component

```ts
export class CarModel {
    #modelName = signal<AvailableModel>("lightning");
    @Input() set modelName(value: AvailableModel) {
        this.#modelName.set(value);
    }

    // oh man, how bad I want: modelName = input<AvailableModel>('lightning');
    gltf = injectGLTF(this.#modelName);
    // ðŸ‘† Signal<GLTF | null>
}
```

Why `Signal<GLTF | null>`? This is because Signal's reactivity model is synchronous. It always has a value. When we design APIs for Signal-first projects,
we want to be explicit about the Signal's value. If it starts out as `null`, then it needs to explicitly let the consumers know so the consumers can handle the
`null` value accordingly.

Next, we'll move on to the implementation of `injectGLTF`

```ts
export function injectGLTF(path: Signal<string>): Signal<GLTF | null> {
    //              ðŸ‘‡ create a Signal and starts out as `null`
    const gltf = signal<GLTF | null>(null);

    // ðŸ‘‡ starts an effect to fetch the model
    effect(() => {
        //              ðŸ‘‡ read the `path` Signal -> registers `path` as a dependency to this Effect
        const _path = path();
        //              ðŸ‘‡ instantiate the GLTFLoader instance (*)
        const loader = new GLTFLoader();
        //      ðŸ‘‡ have the Loader instance fetching for the model
        loader.load(_path, (data) => {
            //    ðŸ‘‡ set the data. This is fine because this happens on a different call stack (async)
            gltf.set(data);
        });
    });

    //          ðŸ‘‡ returns the readonly Signal
    return gltf.asReadonly();
}
```

(*): We can instantiate the `GLTFLoader` instance outside of the Effect. I put it inside of the Effect to show that 
we can **choose** a Loader based on the inputs (it can be a singular `path` or it can be an array of `paths` for a Cube-type Texture Loader).

That's it! Now let's see how we can use it

```ts
@Component({})
export class CarModel {
    #modelName = signal<AvailableModel>("lightning");
    @Input() set modelName(value: AvailableModel) {
        this.#modelName.set(value);
    }

    // 1. we can pass in a function directly to calculate the `/assets` path
    gltf = injectGLTF(() => `assets/${this.#modelName()}.glb`);
    // 2. or we can create a computed
    #assetPath = computed(() => `assets/${this.$modelName()}.glb`);
    gltf = injectGLTF(this.#assetPath);
    // 3. or we can also pass in a function for a **static** value
    gltf = injectGLTF(() => `assets/chau-awesome-car.glb`);

    // then next step is: gltf() on the template
}
```

What's cool about Signal is that we can use `gltf()` on the template, or we can call `gltf()` anywhere we want to get model value (note that it might be `null`).
