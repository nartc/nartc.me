**Custom Inject Function**, or CIF, is my favorite way to compose functionalities in [Angular](https://angular.io) nowadays
thanks to the [`inject`](https://angular.io/api/core/inject) and [Signal](https://angular.io/guide/signals). Check out one
of my previous blog posts on [Abstract inject() the right way](./inject-function-the-right-way) to learn more.

In this blog post, I'll introduce some of my favorites CIFs that I implemented in [`angular-three`](https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three),
an Angular Renderer for [THREE.js](https://threejs.org)

#### 1. `injectBeforeRender()`

THREE.js is an abstraction over [`WebGL API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) and interacts
seamlessly with the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). To interact with Angular Three,
Angular developers utilize the `ngt-canvas` component. Each `ngt-canvas` component starts a separate **Animation Loop**
(i,e: `requestAnimationFrame()`).

When working on 3D projects, it is commonly, if not always, involving running animations on 3D objects.

```ts
function animate() {
    // schedule the animate function in a animation loop
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);

    // change the properties of the 3D object bit by bit on every frame (before render step)
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;

    // then render the scene
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

// starts the render
animate();
```

In Angular Three, the _naive_ way of opting into the Animation Loop is as follow:

```ts
export class Model {
    #store = injectNgtStore();
    #destroyRef = inject(DestroyRef);

    constructor() {
        const unsubscribe = this.#store.get("internal").subscribe(() => {
            /* before render logic */
        });
        this.#destroyRef.onDestroy(unsubscribe);
    }
}
```

This is quite verbose to have to inject two symbols to opt into the Animation Loop. Hence, `angular-three` exposes a CIF called
`injectBeforeRender` which composes `injectNgtStore` and `inject(DestroyRef)`.

```diff
export class Model {
-   #store = injectNgtStore();
-   #destroyRef = inject(DestroyRef);

    constructor() {
-       const unsubscribe = this.#store.get("internal").subscribe(() => {
-           /* before render logic */
-       });
-       this.#destroyRef.onDestroy(unsubscribe);
+       injectBeforeRender(() => {
+           /* before render logic */
+       })
    }
}
```

Code: [https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three/blob/platform/libs/core/src/lib/before-render.ts](https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three/blob/platform/libs/core/src/lib/before-render.ts)

#### 2. `injectNgtsGLTFLoader()`

In addition to running animations in 3D projects, we frequently load external assets like 3D models, textures etc... THREE.js deals with
external assets via a set of [`Loader`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=loader#api/en/loaders/Loader). In this section, we'll take a look at
[`GLTFLoader`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=loader#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) to load a `.glb` model

Let's see how we can do it without `injectNgtsGLTFLoader`

```ts
export class Car {
    #gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader();
    // Optional: Provide a DRACOLoader instance to decode compressed mesh data
    #dracoLoader = new DRACOLoader();

    #model = signal<GLTF | null>(null);
    scene = computed(() => this.#model()?.scene);

    constructor() {
        this.#dracoLoader.setDecoderPath("/examples/jsm/libs/draco/");
        this.#gltfLoader.setDRACOLoader(this.#dracoLoader);

        this.#gltfLoader.load("assets/car.glb", (gltf) => {
            this.#model.set(gltf);
        });
    }
}
```

It is not bad but there are couple of things that are lacking:

-   What if `assets/car.glb` was dynamic (via `Input`)?
-   `gltf` contains more information than just the `scene`. Like `animations` that the GLTF model has. How can we run those animations?

Not to mention, we need to do the same thing for different models components in our 3D projects. Well, `injectNgtsGLTFLoader` solves
_all_ (maybe) the problems. Let's take a look

```diff
export class Car {
-   #gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader();
-   // Optional: Provide a DRACOLoader instance to decode compressed mesh data
-   #dracoLoader = new DRACOLoader();

-   #model = signal<GLTF | null>(null);
+   #model = injectNgtsGLTFLoader(() => 'assets/car.glb');
    scene = computed(() => this.#model()?.scene);

    constructor() {
-       this.#dracoLoader.setDecoderPath("/examples/jsm/libs/draco/");
-       this.#gltfLoader.setDRACOLoader(this.#dracoLoader);

-       this.#gltfLoader.load("assets/car.glb", (gltf) => {
-           this.#model.set(gltf);
-       });
    }
}
```

`injectNgtsGLTFLoader` does several things underneath:

-   Create a `Signal` to store the 3D model data
-   Set up an `effect` to re-fetch if the input changes
    -   Support Array input, Directory input, or single input
-   Allow consumers to specify whether they want to use `DRACOLoader` and/or `MeshoptDecoder`
-   Support for preloading external assets **OUTSIDE** of Angular building blocks

    ```ts
    injectNgtsGLTFLoader.preload(() => "assets/car.glb");

    @Component({})
    export class Car {
        #model = injectNgtsGLTFLoader(() => "assets/car.glb");
        scene = computed(() => this.#model()?.scene);
    }
    ```

In addition, the base `injectNgtLoader()` (which `injectNgtsGLTFLoader` utilizes) handles in-memory cache so the consumers
don't have to load the same asset twice.

Code: [https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three/blob/platform/libs/soba/loaders/src/gltf-loader/gltf-loader.ts](https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three/blob/platform/libs/soba/loaders/src/gltf-loader/gltf-loader.ts)

#### 3. `injectBody()`

`injectBody()` is a CIF that deals with connecting the 3D objects to the Physics World.

> Sorry for the low quality GIF, I had to tune it way down to display it in my blog.

As we can see from the GIF (I hope you could see it ðŸ˜›), there are quite a few things that are happenning
when we deal with Physics

-   The physics engine itself (i.e: `cannonjs`)
-   Attaching the 3D objects (the cubes and planes) to the Body in the Cannon World
-   Reacting to inputs like `debug` and `gravity` etc.
-   Expose APIs to update the properties of the Body in the Cannon World (via Web Worker)

Without `injectBody()`, the amount of code we need to tie 3D objects to the Cannon World would be tremendous and repetitive.

Code: [https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three/blob/platform/libs/cannon/services/src/lib/body.ts](https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three/blob/platform/libs/cannon/services/src/lib/body.ts)

### Conclusion

Above is my 3 favorite CIFs in `angular-three`. There are various other CIFs in `angular-three` but the concept they share is very similar:

-   Compose other CIFs
-   Make use of APIs that rely on the Injection Context (i.e: `inject`, `effect`)
-   Are friendly with Signals. They accept Signals and return Signals

Do you have a favorite CIF or do you have something that could be turned into a CIF? I would love to know! Thanks for reading.
