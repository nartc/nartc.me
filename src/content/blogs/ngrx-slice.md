In this blog post, I want to introduce my latest open source project `[ngrx-slice](https://github.com/nartc/ngrx-slice)`.

## TLDR

- `ngrx-slice` provides the same functionalities as Redux Toolkit `createSlice` provides
- The goal is to reduce NgRx boilerplate, at least for simple feature states.

Run the following command to install:

```bash
npm install ngrx-slice ngrx-immer immer
```

- Consult [documentations](https://ngrx-slice.netlify.app/) for usage details.
- Github repo available at [ngrx-slice](https://github.com/nartc/ngrx-slice)

## What is `ngrx-slice`?

`ngrx-slice` is an [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) plugin that provides almost the same functionalities that [Redux Toolkit createSlice](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice) provides.

At this point, some of you might then ask “Hm… Chau, so what is `createSlice` then?” `createSlice` is dubbed, by [Mark Erikson](https://twitter.com/acemarke) aka the author, as the _modern_ way of implementing [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) in your JavaScript application, especially in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). The idea is to group most, if not all, Redux-related building blocks into a _single slice of the global state_. A _slice_ has multiple layers which _kind of_ represent multiple building blocks of a piece of State: Actions, Reducers, and Selectors.

Let’s take a look at the following Counter example in vanilla Redux:

```jsx
// Actions
const increment = { type: "increment" };
const decrement = { type: "decrement" };

// reducers
const initialState = {
	value: 0,
};

const reducer = (state, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case "increment":
			return { ...state, value: state.value + 1 };
		case "decrement":
			return { ...state, value: state.value - 1 };
		default:
			return state;
	}
};

// selectors
const selectValue = (state) => state.counter.value;
```

> Note that Actions, Reducers, and Selectors can be (and most of the time recommended) separated out into different files. So you might have: counter/actions.js, counter/reducer.js, and counter/selectors.js

Now let’s look at the same example with `createSlice` API:

```jsx
const counterSlice = createSlice({
	name: "counter",
	initialState: {
		value: 0,
	},
	reducers: {
		increment: (state) => {
			// Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
			// doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
			// which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
			// immutable state based off those changes
			state.value++;
		},
		decrement: (state) => {
			state.value--;
		},
	},
});

export default counterSlice.reducer;
export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;

export const selectValue = (state) => state.counter.value;
```

> To learn more about this createSlice API, please refer to Redux Toolkit createSlice

You can already notice the amount of code is much less in `createSlice` version with Actions being generated from the Reducers. Coupled with [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) for simpler state updates, the boilerplate becomes manageable.

`ngrx-slice` embraces this same idea, but for NgRx

## Why?

The main goal of `ngrx-slice` is an attempt to reduce the amount of boilerplate of NgRx, at least for _simpler_ features. A by-product goal of `ngrx-slice` is to ease the learning curve to NgRx for React developers who now work with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and NgRx.

Imagine having the ability to reduce the following code (Counter example with NgRx):

```tsx
export const increment = creaeteAction("[Counter] Increment");
export const decrement = createAction("[Counter] Decrement");
// putting in some effect just to make a point
export const multiplyBy = createAction(
	"[Counter] Multiply By",
	prop<{ multiplier: number }>(),
);
export const multiplyBySuccess = createAction(
	"[Counter] Multiply By Success",
	prop<{ value: number }>(),
);
```

```tsx
export interface CounterState {
	value: number;
	incrementCount: number;
	decrementCount: number;
}

export const initialState: CounterState = {
	value: 0,
	incrementCount: 0,
	decrementCount: 0,
};

export const counterReducer = createReducer(
	initialState,
	on(increment, (state) => ({
		...state,
		value: state.value + 1,
		incrementCount: state.incrementCount + 1,
	})),
	on(decrement, (state) => ({
		...state,
		value: state.value - 1,
		decrementCount: state.decrementCount + 1,
	})),
	on(multiplyBySuccess, (state, { value }) => ({ ...state, value })),
);
```

```tsx
export const selectCounter = createFeatureSelector<CounterState>("counter");
export const selectValue = createSelector(
	selectCounter,
	(state) => state.value,
);
export const selectIncrementCount = createSelector(
	selectorCounter,
	(state) => state.incrementCount,
);
export const selectDecrementCount = createSelector(
	selectorCounter,
	(state) => state.decrementCount,
);
```

The following effect is included for completeness. `ngrx-slice` does not affect how you write your Effects.

```tsx
@Injectable()
export class CounterEffects {
	constructor(
		private store: Store,
		private actions$: Actions,
	) {}

	readonly multiplyBy = createEffect(() =>
		this.actions$.pipe(
			ofType(multiplyBy),
			concatLatestFrom(() => this.store.select(selectValue)),
			// switchMap to a mock side-effect (timer)
			switchMap(([{ multiplier }, currentValue]) =>
				// delay 1s to simulate async task
				timer(1000).pipe(
					map(() => multiplyBySuccess({ value: currentValue * multiplier })),
				),
			),
		),
	);
}
```

The above snippets are pretty _standard_ in NgRx world. Most of the time, you will have all of those files for each of your feature states. And to be honest, it does feel a bit overwhelming, especially for NgRx beginners. Let’s explore how `ngrx-slice` can help with this.

## How?

### Installation

Like most things JavaScript/TypeScript, we start with installing `ngrx-slice`

```bash
npm install ngrx-slice ngrx-immer immer
```

> `ngrx-slice` depends on `ngrx-immer` and `immer` to allow for simpler state updates, just like `createSlice`

### Implementing the Slice

Instead of the 3 different files for Actions, Reducers, and Selectors, you’d have a Slice file.

```tsx
export interface CounterState {
	value: number;
	incrementCount: number;
	decrementCount: number;
}

export const initialState: CounterState = {
	value: 0,
	incrementCount: 0,
	decrementCount: 0,
};

export const {
	selectors: CounterSelectors,
	actions: CounterActions,
	...CounterFeature
} = createSlice({
	name: "counter",
	initialState,
	reducers: {
		increment: (state) => {
			state.value++;
			state.incrementCount++;
		},
		decrement: (state) => {
			state.value--;
			state.decrementCount++;
		},
		multiplyBy: {
			trigger: noopReducer<CounterState, { multiplier: number }>(),
			success: (state, { value }: PayloadAction<{ value: number }>) => {
				state.value = value;
			},
		},
	},
});
```

> `createSlice`, `noopReducer()`, and `PayloadAction` are imported from `ngrx-slice`

That’s all. Just like Redux Toolkit’s `createSlice`, `ngrx-slice` accepts a `SliceOptions` object and returns the Reducer, generated Actions, and **in addition** the Selectors. For a more detailed explanation, please check out [ngrx-slice Documentations](https://ngrx-slice.netlify.app/)

### Using the Slice

The return value of `createSlice` is an object with the shape `{ actions, selectors, name, reducer }`. With destructuring, `CounterFeature` here is actually an object of `{ name, reducer }`, which is compatible with `StoreModule.forFeature()`

```tsx
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    /* ... */
    // before: StoreModule.forFeature({ name: 'counter', reducer: counterReducer })
    StoreModule.forFeature(CounterFeature),
    EffectsModule.forFeature([CounterEffect]),
    /* ... */
  ],
  declarations: [CounterComponent],
})
```

`CounterSelectors` and `CounterActions` are just namespacing the generated Actions and Selectors. With this, `counter.effect.ts` can be modified like so:

```tsx
@Injectable()
export class CounterEffects {
	constructor(
		private store: Store,
		private actions$: Actions,
	) {}

	readonly multiplyBy = createEffect(() =>
		this.actions$.pipe(
			// using multiplyBy.trigger
			ofType(CounterActions.multiplyBy.trigger),
			concatLatestFrom(() => this.store.select(CounterSelectors.selectValue)),
			// switchMap to a mock side-effect (timer)
			switchMap(([{ multiplier }, currentValue]) =>
				// delay 1s to simulate async task
				timer(1000).pipe(
					// return multiplyBy.success action
					map(() =>
						CounterActions.multiplyBy.success({
							value: currentValue * multiplier,
						}),
					),
				),
			),
		),
	);
}
```

You can see that for simple features like a Counter, all the logic is handled in a single `counter.slice.ts`, and every building block is generated thanks to TypeScript.

## Miscellaneous

Of course, there will be cases where more complex features do not benefit as much from `ngrx-slice` but it does not mean you cannot use `ngrx-slice` for those. The returned `selectors` and `actions` are just abstractions using `createSelector` and `createAction` under the hood. Hence, you can use/compose those like normal NgRx Selectors.

Entity is something tricky when used with `ngrx-slice`. Supposedly, [ngrx/entity](https://ngrx.io/guide/entity) helps with providing utilities to _immutably_ update list data. With `ngrx-slice`, you can update your list/array _mutably_ with Immer. For example:

```tsx
// adding a new item to a list
// immutable way
[...state.items, newItem];
// ngrx/entity
entity.addOne(newItem, state);
// ngrx-slice
state.items.push(newItem);
```

That is all. Go ahead and give `ngrx-slice` a try.
