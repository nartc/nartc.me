## What is `SharedModule` anyway?

To set up some context for this post, here's a typical `SharedModule`

```ts
@NgModule({
	declarations: [ComponentA, ComponentB, ComponentC, ComponentD],
	exports: [ComponentA, ComponentB, ComponentC, ComponentD],
})
export class SharedModule {}
```

Or more than often, we usually have a `SharedModule` for re-exporting 3rd party Modules

```ts
@NgModule({
	imports: [MatButtonModule, MatTableModule, MatCardModule],
	exports: [MatButtonModule, MatTableModule, MatCardModule],
})
export class SharedMaterialModule {}
```

With this in place, we can import `SharedMaterialModule` to have access to `MatButtonModule`, `MatTableModule`, and `MatCardModule`.
Now that we have an idea of what `SharedModule` is, let's explore why `SharedModule` is _not_ as clever as we thought it would be.

## Scenario 1: Internal `SharedModule`

### Problem

- Lazy-load `FooModule`
- Lazy-load `BarModule`
- `SharedModule` declares `SharedAComponent` and `SharedBComponent`
- `FooModule` uses `SharedAComponent` by importing `SharedModule`
- `BarModule` uses `SharedBComponent` by importing `SharedModule`

<BlogImage

	src={sharedModuleOne}
	alt="A screenshot showing bundlesize of FooModule, BarModule, and SharedModule"
/>

From Screenshot 1, we can see that `SharedModule` is separated into its own chunk. This makes the size of `FooModule` and `BarModule` small, which appears to be a good thing.

However, both `FooModule` and `BarModule` are **lazy-loaded** modules. It means, in practice, our users _might_ land only on `FooModule` (eg: `/foo`) and never need to load `BarModule` (and vice versa).
When we load **either** `FooModule` **or** `BarModule`, we load `SharedModule`.

Why is this a _bad_ thing? Because `FooModule` only uses `SharedAComponent`, but we also load `SharedBComponent` since we load the whole `SharedModule`.
This is **wasted**! Imagine having EVERY _shared_ components in `SharedModule`, that would be a huge waste. In other words, it kind of defeats the purpose of your lazy-loaded modules in my opinion.

### Solution

The easiest solution is to apply **Single-Component-as-Module** (or **SCAM**) here for `SharedAComponent` and `SharedBComponent`. Learn more about [SCAM](https://blog.angularindepth.com/emulating-tree-shakable-components-using-single-component-angular-modules-5e3d380364ea)

<BlogImage
	sizes="960px"
	src={sharedModuleTwo}
	alt="A screenshot showing bundlesize of FooModule, BarModule, with two SCAMs"
/>

After we apply **SCAM** to the two shared components, we will end up with Screenshot 2. `FooModule` bundle size is getting slightly larger because `SharedAModule` is bundled together with it (the same applies to `BarModule` and `SharedBModule`).
However, when our users land on `FooModule`, we will truly only load what the users actually need: `FooModule` and `SharedAComponent` without loading the unnecessary `SharedBComponent`

## Scenario 2: External modules

This scenario is somewhat _out of our control_ but we will explore it as well.

- Only `FooModule` utilizes `FormsModule`
- Both `FooModule` and `BarModule` utilize `FormsModule`

<BlogImage
	sizes="960px"
	src={sharedModuleThree}
	alt="A screenshot showing bundlesize of FooModule and FormsModule"
/>

<BlogImage
	sizes="960px"
	src={sharedModuleFour}
	alt="A screenshot showing bundlesize of FooModule, BarModule, and FormsModule"
/>

Here, you can see that if only `FooModule` needs `FormsModule`, then Angular will know to include `FormsModule` together with `FooModule` bundle, so that if our users land on `BarModule`, we don't need to load `FormsModule` for them. (Screenshot 3)

On the other hand, if both `FooModule` and `BarModule` need `FormsModule`, then Angular will separate `FormsModule` into a common chunk so `FormsModule` is only loaded once. (Screenshot 4)

## Conclusion

Main take-away is that Angular is smart enough to help you enhance the users' experience with your application. Embrace Single-Component-as-Module, you'll only pay for what you (or your users) need.Main take-away is that Angular is smart enough to help you enhance the users' experience with your application.
