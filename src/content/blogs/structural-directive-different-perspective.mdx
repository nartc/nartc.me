In [Angular](https://angular.io), **Structural Directives** are directives that can alter the DOM layout by **dynamically** adding or removing elements. Up until Angular 17, we are familiar with the common directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`. However, these directives are replaced by [built-in control flows blocks](https://angular.dev/essentials/conditionals-and-loops#if-block), but structural directive concept itself is [here-to-stay](https://github.com/angular/angular/discussions/50719). With that being said, this blog post aims to take your understanding of Structural Directives to the next level and show how they are **more** than just control flows.

## Context

Before we dive in, I should layout some context

First of all, I'm the maintainer of [angular-three](https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three), a [THREE.js](https://threejs.org) integration for Angular. The example in this blog post is taken from a feature in `angular-three` that enables one of the most important building blocks of THREE.js

Secondly, `angular-three` has gone through several iterations with different implementations:

- Wrappers with Components and Directives
- Proxied constructors with Directives
- Custom Renderer.

> Although a bit old, you can read more about the `Renderer` concept in this [blog post by Victor Savkin](https://blog.nrwl.io/experiments-with-angular-renderers-c5f647d4fd9e)

At the moment, `angular-three` is a custom Renderer which allows me to own the Angular Template where the `angular-three` renderer is in control.

Next, the blog post is indeed about Structural Directives but to get to the point, we'd need to make several round trips to know how Angular works under the hood. So, stay with me, it'll be worth it ðŸ¤ž

Last but not least, this blog post assumes some basic understanding of Angular in general, and specifically Structural Directives. If the summary at the beginning of the blog post doesn't make you start envisioning some `<div *ngIf=""></div>` in your head, I'd highly recommend you checking out the [official documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/directives#built-in-structural-directives) on the matter before continue on.

> Some basic understanding of [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) or THREE.js would allow the example to stick with you easier but it is definitely not required.

## The important building blocks of THREE.js

THREE.js is an abstraction over WebGL and is mainly used to build 3D applications on the web. Here's a complete snippet of a simple [THREE.js application](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)

```js
import * as THREE from "three";

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
	75,
	window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
	0.1,
	1000,
);

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

camera.position.z = 5;

function animate() {
	requestAnimationFrame(animate);

	cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
	cube.rotation.y += 0.01;

	renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

animate();
```

Here, we can see THREE.js needs to have:

- A `Scene`, a `Camera`, and a `Renderer`: these are used to actually render our Scene Graph in an animation loop.
- Objects that can go onto the `Scene`: in this case, it is a `Mesh` with a `BoxGeometry` and a `MeshBasicMaterial`

We will not dive too deep into THREE.js in this blog post but we need at least this basic understanding to digest the next sections. From the above snippet, let's take a closer look at the following:

```js
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
```

- Geometries in THREE.js accept positional parameters (i.e: construction arguments). These parameters are sent to the GPU to build up the vertices that determine the shape of this object.
  `new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)` tells the GPU to build a cube with `[width: 1, height: 1, depth: 1]`.
- Materials in THREE.js accept object paramters. These parameters are sent to the shader on every frame so they are safe to be dynamically updated anytime.
  ```js
  const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
  // is pretty much the same as
  const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();
  material.color.setHex(0x00ff00);
  ```

Next, let's talk about `angular-three`

## How would this look like in Angular?

In `angular-three`, the `Scene`, `Camera`, and `Renderer` are taken care of by a single top-level component called `ngt-canvas`. The objects, on the other hand, are the developers' responsibility (and that's where the fun is).

For the above THREE.js example, here's how it'd **partially** look like in `angular-three`

```html
<ngt-mesh>
	<!-- notice no construction arguments for now -->
	<ngt-box-geometry />
	<!-- notice no parameters for now -->
	<ngt-mesh-basic-material />
</ngt-mesh>
```

This translates into the following code in THREE.js:

```js
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
scene.add(mesh);

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
mesh.geometry = geometry;

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();
mesh.material = material;
```

We're close! The `BoxGeometry` and `MeshBasicMaterial` need some parameters though. Before we dive into that, let's take a side-track and look at how Angular Renderer works roughly.

#### How does Angular Renderer work (roughly)?

[Angular Renderer](https://angular.dev/api/core/Renderer2) is responsible for understanding the elements that the developers put on the template.
Considering the following template and its compiled version

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="HTML"> 
```html
<div>
    <span>Child</span>
    <app-child-cmp />
</div>
```       
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Compiled">
```js
_AppComponent.Éµcmp = /* @__PURE__ */
    i0.ÉµÉµdefineComponent({
        type: _AppComponent,
        selectors: [["app-root"]],
        standalone: true,
        features: [i0.ÉµÉµStandaloneFeature],
        decls: 4,
        vars: 0,
        template: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {
            if (rf & 1) {
                i0.ÉµÉµelementStart(0, "div")(1, "span");
                i0.ÉµÉµtext(2, "Child");
                i0.ÉµÉµelementEnd();
                i0.ÉµÉµelement(3, "app-child-cmp");
                i0.ÉµÉµelementEnd();
            }
        },
        dependencies: [ChildCmp],
        encapsulation: 2
    });
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The **Compiled** tab shows how Angular compiles our `AppComponent`. The _HTML_ template has been compiled into a `AppComponent_Template` function. In the compiled template function, we see the [Template Instructions](https://youtu.be/jnp_ny4SOQE?t=1320) that Angular Core generates do not have any knowledge that a `div` is an `HTMLDivElement`, a `span` is an `HTMLSpanElement`, and so on. That is the job of the underlying platform's renderer (that implements [`Renderer2`](https://angular.dev/api/core/Renderer2)).

By default, an Angular CLI application is bootstraped by `@angular/platform-browser` with `DefaultDomRenderer` being the default `Renderer2`. With this in mind, the `elementStart` instruction will eventually invoke `Renderer.createElement()` method and this is the earliest point in time where an `HTMLDivElement` is instantiated.

With that out of the way, let's take a closer look at the first parameter of the compiled template function, `rf`. `rf` stands for [`RenderFlags`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/core/src/render3/interfaces/definition.ts#L57), which has 2 values `Create` and `Update`.

- `rf & 1` check is when the component is in `Create` phase. No bindings happen in this phase.
- `rf & 2` check is when the component is in `Update` phase. Bindings happen in this phase. Upon Change Detection's tick, the template function is re-invoked with `RenderFlags.Update` as the value for `rf` which satisfies the `rf & 2` check. Consequently, this re-invokes the Template Instructions responsible for the bindings on our template.

Additionally, let's add some bindings to our template.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="HTML"> 
```html
<div>
    <!--    ðŸ‘‡ attribute binding -->
    <span data-dummy="chau">Child</span>
    <!--            ðŸ‘‡ property binding -->
    <app-child-cmp [foo]="text" />
</div>
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Compiled">
```js
 _AppComponent.Éµcmp = /* @__PURE__ */
    i0.ÉµÉµdefineComponent({
        type: _AppComponent,
        selectors: [["app-root"]],
        standalone: true,
        features: [i0.ÉµÉµStandaloneFeature],
        decls: 4,
        vars: 1,
        // ðŸ‘‡ new "consts" array to store constants on the template
        consts: [["data-dummy", "chau"], [3, "foo"]],
        template: function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {
            if (rf & 1) {
                //                                    ðŸ‘‡ this call for "span" now accepts a new argument "0"
                i0.ÉµÉµelementStart(0, "div")(1, "span", 0);
                i0.ÉµÉµtext(2, "Child");
                i0.ÉµÉµelementEnd();
                //          ðŸ‘‡ notice this "3" index
                i0.ÉµÉµelement(3, "app-child-cmp", 1);
                i0.ÉµÉµelementEnd();
            }
            // ðŸ‘‡ Update phase check
            if (rf & 2) {
                //          ðŸ‘‡ notice this "3" index
                i0.ÉµÉµadvance(3);
                //  ðŸ‘‡ new "property" instruction
                i0.ÉµÉµproperty("foo", ctx.text);
            }
        },
        dependencies: [ChildCmp],
        encapsulation: 2
    });
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

By adding an **Attribute Binding** and a **Property Binding** to our template, the compiled template function has changed quite a bit. Let's parse through the changes.

> **Attribute Binding** isn't technically a correct term because there's no _"binding"_ with Attributes since they are static.

- A new `consts` array is generated. Notice how our `data-dummy=chau` becomes `["data-dummy", "chau"]` and how it is in the `0` position of the `consts` array. `consts` holds more information than just Attribute Bindings but we will not get into that in this blog post.
- `elementStart` call for `"span"` is invoked with an additional argument `0`. Notice how this is the same index as the `data-dummy=chau` attribute in the `consts` array. This means that Angular is able to set the attribute `data-dummy` to the `HTMLSpanElement`, **at the time the element is instantiated**, during the `Create` phase.
- New instructions, `advance` and `property`, are generated in the `Update` phase.
  - `advance` tells Angular to go to the `Node` with this index (i.e: `3`)
  - `property` is responsible for **Property Binding**. Here, `property` is invoked with `"foo"` and `ctx.text` where `foo` is the name of our `ChildCmp` Input and `ctx.text` is `AppComponent.text` field.

An important point to note is that `property` instruction is part of the `Update` phase which means that **Property Binding** does not happen until the `Update` phase. To many Angular developers, this is commonly known as _"when the Change Detection runs and updates the template's bindings"_. As a side note, we can connect this knowledge back to _"When is an Input resolved in Angular component?"_, it actually makes more sense now, doesn't it?

```ts
@Component({
	selector: "my-cmp",
})
export class MyCmp {
	@Input() foo = "initial";

	constructor() {
		console.log(this.foo); // logs "initial"
	}

	ngOnInit() {
		console.log(this.foo); // logs "from app component"
	}
}

@Component({
	template: `
		<my-cmp [foo]="'from app component'" />
	`,
})
export class AppCmp {}
```

So what is the take away here?

**Angular creates the elements before Property Bindings has the chance to be set on the elements. And Attribute Bindings
only work with `string` values so they are limited.**

#### Apply what we know to `angular-three`

Let's bring back our `angular-three` template that creates a `Mesh`

```html
<ngt-mesh>
	<ngt-box-geometry />
	<ngt-mesh-basic-material />
</ngt-mesh>
```

As we learned above, `MeshBasicMaterial` parameters can be **safely** set after the material is created. Hence,
we can **safely** rely on Property Bindings to set parameters for `MeshBasicMaterial`.

```html
<ngt-mesh>
	<ngt-box-geometry />
	<ngt-mesh-basic-material [color]="materialColor" />
</ngt-mesh>
```

This translates roughly to the following THREE.js code

```ts
/* removed for brevity */

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();
mesh.material = material;

// sometimes in the future
material.color.setHex(materialColor);
```

Now, this leaves us `new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)` and this is the problem considering how THREE.js expects Geometries to behave

**How do we pass an expression (yes, it can be dynamic and cannot be a static `string` value) at the time that the element is created?**

In other words, what we want to achieve is to **defer the instantiation of `<ngt-box-geometry />` declaratively on the template**. Anything comes to mind?

Not yet...OK, let's rephrase that a little differently this time. **How can we wait for some expression to be evaluated before we start rendering `<ngt-box-geometry />`**? _(keywords: wait, expression, evaluated, start rendering)_

Yes, this phrasing reminds us of Structural Directives. These directives evaluate some expressions and then `createEmbeddedView` dynamically **afterwards**. At this point, we know that we want to use Structural Directive to solve **the problem**, but how though?

> Whew, we are finally talking about Structural Directives. I truly hope I haven't bored you yet ðŸ¤ž

## Structural Directive for Construction Arguments

To model passing in construction arguments to THREE.js entities, `angular-three` provides a directive called `NgtArgs` and it is used like this

```html
<!-- new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1) -->
<ngt-box-geometry *args="[1, 1, 1]" />
<!-- new OrbitControls(camera, domElement) -->
<ngt-orbit-controls *args="[camera, domElement]" />
```

Why don't we re-build `NgtArgs` to see how it works?

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="args.directive.ts">
```ts
@Directive({
    selector: '[args]',
    standalone: true
})
export class NgtArgs {
    @Input() set args(args: any[]) {
        // let's assume args is always valid for now
        if (this.embeddedViewRef) {
            // if args changes, we will need to reconstruct the THREE.js entities
            this.embeddedViewRef.destroy();
        }
        // TODO: ??
        this.embeddedViewRef = this.vcr.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef);
    }
    private vcr = inject(ViewContainerRef);
    private templateRef = inject(TemplateRef);
    private embeddedViewRef?: EmbeddedViewRef;
}
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="HTML"> 
```html
<ngt-box-geometry *args="[1, 1, 1]" />
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Notice that `TODO`? Yes, we are able to defer the rendering of `ngt-box-geometry` until we have `[1, 1, 1]` available in `NgtArgs` but we haven't
done anything with `[1, 1, 1]` yet. This brings up another problem: **How can we access this `args` in our element instantiation logic, aka the renderer?**

In order to understand the next part, let's look at a simplified version of `Renderer.createElement()`

```ts
// Our custom renderer
export class CustomRenderer implements Renderer2 {
	createElement(name: string, namespace?: string | null | undefined) {
		// name will be `ngt-box-geometry` when Angular tries rendering `ngt-box-geometry`
		const threeTarget = getThreeTargetFromName(name); // this will return the actual BoxGeometry class from THREE.js
		if (threeTarget) {
			//                          ðŸ‘‡ we need to pass the args, [1, 1, 1], here
			const node = new threeTarget(); // this is where we instantiate the BoxGeometry.
		}
	}
}
```

This is a very tricky problem because we can see that `createElement` **does not** give us a whole lot of information surrounding the element being created beside its `name`. To solve this, it's important to understand how Angular treats Structural Directives, and to comprehend the sequence in which the Angular Renderer operates in relation to the Structural Directives. It is also important to understand this process in conjunction with the dynamically generated `EmbeddedViewRef`.

#### Structural Directive and Comment node

Once again, here's our template with `*args` structural directive

```html
<ngt-box-geometry *args="[1, 1, 1]" />
```

For folks that are not aware, `*args` is the [short-hand syntax](https://angular.dev/guide/directives/structural-directives#structural-directive-syntax-reference) for Structural Directive. The `*` syntax is expanded in to the following long form

```html
<ng-template [args]="[1, 1, 1]">
	<ngt-box-geometry />
</ng-template>
```

Well well, what have we here? Remember how we `inject(TemplateRef)` in our `NgtArgs` directive? In the long-form, we can easily see where the `TemplateRef` comes from. Our `NgtArgs` directive is attached on an `ng-template` element making the instance of `TemplateRef` available to `NgtArgs` directive.

Next, let's check the compiled code

```js
function AppComponent_ngt_box_geometry_0_Template(rf, ctx) {
	if (rf & 1) {
		i0.ÉµÉµelement(0, "ngt-box-geometry");
	}
}

function AppComponent_Template(rf, ctx) {
	if (rf & 1) {
		i0.ÉµÉµtemplate(
			0,
			AppComponent_ngt_box_geometry_0_Template,
			1,
			0,
			"ngt-box-geometry",
			0,
		);
	}
	if (rf & 2) {
		i0.ÉµÉµproperty("args", [1, 1, 1]);
	}
}
```

Woohoo, new instruction! The `template` instruction is responsible for handling `ng-template`. Internally, Angular creates a [`Comment`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Comment) in place of the `ng-template`. Additionally, Angular also creates an [`ElementInjector`](https://angular.dev/guide/di/hierarchical-dependency-injection#elementinjector) associated with the `Comment` node **IF** there is at least one directive attached on the `ng-template`, and in our case, that directive is `NgtArgs`. This also means that
if we can get a hold of that `Comment` node, we _technically_ can access the `NgtArgs` directive instance that is attached on that `Comment` node.

<BlogImage
	sizes="960px"
	src={commentScreenshot}
	alt="A screenshot of the Comment node and its Injector (NgtArgs instance is visible at the bottom)"
/>

Another important point is Angular creates the `Comment` node first, then the `NgtArgs` directive will be instantiated with the `property` instruction, in the `Update` phase. Now, how do we track the created `Comment`? Our Custom Renderer will do that.

#### Tracking the `Comment` nodes

To create a `Comment` node, Angular Core invokes `Renderer#createComment` method and since we're using a Custom Renderer, we are able to intercept this call to track the created `Comment`. Here's the snippet of `createComment`

```ts
createComment(value: string) {
    //              ðŸ‘‡ the platform Renderer; in our case, this would be the default DomRenderer from `platform-browser`
    return this.platformRenderer.createComment(value);
}
```

We can modify `createComment` like this:

```ts
createComment(value: string) {
    const commentNode = this.platformRenderer.createComment(value);
    // Do something with the commentNode before returning it
    return commentNode;
}
```

#### Access the `Injector` on the `Comment`

Tracking the `Comment` alone will not be enough, we need the `Injector` which allows us to access the `NgtArgs` instance. Let's go back to `NgtArgs` and add some code

```ts
@Directive({
	selector: "[args]",
	standalone: true,
})
export class NgtArgs {
	@Input() set args(args: any[]) {
		// let's assume args is always valid for now
		if (this.embeddedViewRef) {
			// if args changes, we will need to reconstruct the THREE.js entities
			this.embeddedViewRef.destroy();
		}
		this.embeddedViewRef = this.vcr.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef);
	}
	private vcr = inject(ViewContainerRef);
	private templateRef = inject(TemplateRef);
	private embeddedViewRef?: EmbeddedViewRef;

	constructor() {
		// let's log the ViewContainerRef to see what we have on here (you can log other stuffs too)
		console.log(this.vcr);
	}
}
```

<BlogImage
	sizes="960px"
	src={vcrScreenshot}
	alt="A screenshot of the ViewContainerRef on the directive"
/>

And voila, we found our `Injector`. The `ViewContainerRef` also contains the `element` which is the `Comment` node that the Renderer created. Great!

> `ViewContainerRef` contains all the information we need but we can inject `ElementRef` and `Injector` explicitly.

So what do we know so far?

- The `Comment` will be created before the `NgtArgs` directive is instantiated, which means that `NgtArgs` constructor runs **after** the `Comment` is created
- `ViewContainerRef` contains the `Injector` along with the `Comment`.

Then what can we do?

- We can attach some arbitrary function on the `Comment` node.
- We then get the instance of the `Comment` node using the `ViewContainerRef` and invoke this function in our directive. At this point, we can pass anything we want
  to our Renderer.

> There are different approaches to do this but this is what Angular Three is doing at the moment.

Let's adjust `createComment` as well as `NgtArgs`

    }
}
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alright, now we have the `Injector[]` that we're tracking, we can adjust `Renderer#createElement()` to make use of the `Injector`

```ts
export class CustomRenderer implements Renderer2 {
	createElement(name: string, namespace?: string | null | undefined) {
		// name will be `ngt-box-geometry` when Angular tries rendering `ngt-box-geometry`
		const threeTarget = getThreeTargetFromName(name); // this will return the actual BoxGeometry class from THREE.js
		if (threeTarget) {
			let args: any[] = [];
			// we'll loop over the `Injector` array and attempt to inject NgtArgs
			for (const commentInjector of this.comments) {
				const ngtArgs = commentInjector.get(NgtArgs, null);
				if (!ngtArgs) continue;
				const injectedArgs = ngtArgs.injectedArgs;
				if (!injectedArgs) continue;
				args = injectedArgs;

That is how we inject data (or constructor arguments) to `createElement`, using Structural Directive.

> Angular Three implementation is a lot more involved with performance as well as validation. The implementation in this blog post is just to give the readers the idea of manipulating Structural Directives

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've explored a niche, yet technical, use-case of using Structural Directive to **defer** (not `@defer` ðŸ˜›) the instantiation
of some element on the template. We've learned that Structural Directives are much more than show and hide elements. Additionally, we've also learned
about different `RenderFlags` that Angular Core implements as well as some Template Instructions and their purposes. Last but not least, we've also learned
about `ng-template` and the `Comment` node along with all the surrounding technical details.

I hope I was able to provide a different perspective for Structural Directive, and an in-depth guide as to how Structural Directive works. After all, I hope
you were able to learn something new and have fun learning it. See y'all in the next blog post.
