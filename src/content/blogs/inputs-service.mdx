I recently shared my [thoughts](https://twitter.com/Nartc1410/status/1657385450867138560) on Twitter about how Angular is missing Props Spreading, resulting in a subpar experience with Component Composition. Let's take a moment to explore what Component Composition means in this context.

## What is Composition?

**Composition**, particularly **Component Composition**, is a pattern of composing different UI Elements to build other UI Elements. In Angular, there are various ways to utilize Component Composition: [Content Projection](https://angular.io/guide/content-projection), [Directives](https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives), [Template Ref](https://angular.io/api/core/TemplateRef), and [Services](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services)

Each provides different solutions to different use cases. Here's an example:

```ts
@Component({
	selector: "app-title",
	standalone: true,
	template: `
		<h1 style="...">
			<ng-content />
		</h1>
	`,
	host: { style: "display: contents" },
})
export class Title {}

@Component({
	selector: "app-root",
	standalone: true,
	template: `
		<app-title>Inputs Service</app-title>
	`,
	imports: [Title],
})
export class App {}
```

<em>
	Using <strong>Content Projection</strong>
</em>

Another example of using Directive to compose UI Elements

```ts
@Directive({
	selector: "button[appButton]",
	standalone: true,
	host: { style: "custom button style" },
})
export class Button {}

@Component({
	selector: "app-root",
	standalone: true,
	template: `
		<button appButton>My Button</button>
	`,
	imports: [Button],
})
export class App {}
```

<em>
	Using <strong>Directive</strong>
</em>

Numerous use cases and online resources offer detailed explanations of these methods. Therefore, exploring those resources for an in-depth understanding of Component Composition is advisable.

## What is Props Spreading?

**Props Spreading** is a technique in JSX-based technologies like React or SolidJS. Props Spreading is not an enabler of Component Composition, but it makes it much easier and more strongly typed.

```ts
export interface AlertProps {
    severity: "success" | "error" | "warning";
    /* and some other props */
}

export function Alert(props: AlertProps) {
    /* some implementation of an Alert component with different Severities */
    return <div></div>;
}
```

<em>

	<code>severity</code> levels
</em>

`Alert` is acceptable to use on its own. However, we can provide some abstractions to make it easier to use. For example, we can create `SuccessAlert`, `ErrorAlert`, and `WarningAlert` so the consumers do not have to keep providing `severity` prop for `Alert` component.

```ts
type AlertPropsWithoutSeverity = Omit<AlertProps, "severity">;

export function SuccessAlert(props: AlertPropsWithoutSeverity) {
    return <Alert severity="success" {...props} />;
}
// ErrorAlert and WarningAlert are similar
```

<em>
	<code>SuccessAlert</code> is now easier to use and maintains type definitions
	for every other prop than `severity`
</em>

## Problem

Back to the [tweet](https://twitter.com/Nartc1410/status/1657385450867138560), the context here is that I have a `NgtsEnvironment` component. This component determines which type of components to render based on some inputs. There are `NgtsEnvironmentCube`, `NgtsEnvironmentMap`, `NgtsEnvironmentGround`, and `NgtsEnvironmentPortal`.

It is troublesome for consumers to figure out which one they need to remember to use. Hence, `NgtsEnvironment` helps abstract this decision away. The problem is `NgtsEnvironment` has the **same set of Inputs** with all four types. Without something like **Props Spreading**, this results in many duplications in Component code and on the Template.

> Disclaimer: `NgtsEnvironment` is a port of `Environment` from React Three Fiber ecosystem. It is already a lot of work to port these components from React over to Angular, so I did not spend additional time attempting to re-design these components to fit Angular's mental model better. Thus, the complaint ðŸ˜…

What can we do? Are we completely stuck without some form of **Props Spreading**? Nope, we can do better.

## Inputs Service

The solution here is not entirely on-par with **Props Spreading**, but it alleviates some pain I am running into. And I want to share it with the world.

> Disclaimer: We'll be using **Signals**. We'll use `#` private instead of TypeScript `private` keyword. We can debate either in real-world situations because `#` makes Debugging a little trickier.

As mentioned above, Service is also a means to achieve Component Composition in Angular. Instead of duplicating the Inputs on all components, we can have the `NgtsEnvironment` declare the Inputs and a Service to store those Inputs' values. The other components (`NgtsEnvironment***`) can inject the Service to read those Inputs.

Before we start, we will shorten our Inputs to 5-6 and render 3 components: `NgtsEnvironmentGround`, `NgtsEnvironmentCube`, and `NgtsEnvironmentMap` for brevity. Let me remind everyone what `NgtsEnvironment` template would look like with 3 Inputs and 3 component types.

```html
<ngts-environment-ground
	*ngIf="environmentGround();else noGround"
	[ground]="environmentGround()"
	[map]="environmentMap()"
	[background]="environmentBackground()"
	[frames]="environmentFrames()"
	[near]="environmentNear()"
	[far]="environmentFar()"
	[resolution]="environmentResolution()"
/>
<ng-template #noGround>
	<ngts-environment-map
		*ngIf="environmentMap();else noMap"
		[map]="environmentMap()"
		[background]="environmentBackground()"
		[frames]="environmentFrames()"
		[near]="environmentNear()"
		[far]="environmentFar()"
		[resolution]="environmentResolution()"
	/>
	<ng-template #noMap>
		<ngts-environment-cube
			[background]="environmentBackground()"
			[frames]="environmentFrames()"
			[near]="environmentNear()"
			[far]="environmentFar()"
			[resolution]="environmentResolution()"
		/>
	</ng-template>
</ng-template>
```

Let's start with our solution now.

```ts
@Injectable()
export class NgtsEnvironmentInputs {
	readonly #environmentInputs = signal<NgtsEnvironmentInputsState>({});

	readonly ground = computed(() => this.#environmentInputs().ground);
	/* we'll expose a computed for each Input */

	// re-expose SettableSignal#set
	set = this.#environmentInputs.set.bind(this.#environmentInputs);

	/**
	 * Abstract SettableSignal#update so we can do
	 * this.service.update(partialState);
	 * eg: this.service.update({ foo: 'new foo' }); // { foo: 'new foo', bar: 'bar' }
	 *     this.service.update({ bar: 'new bar' }); // { foo: 'new foo', bar: 'new bar' }
	 */
	update(partial: Partial<NgtsEnvironmentInputsState>) {
		this.#environmentInputs.update((s) => ({ ...s, ...partial }));
	}
}

@Component({
	selector: "ngts-environment",
	standalone: true,
	template: `
		...
	`,
	providers: [NgtsEnvironmentInputs],
})
export class NgtsEnvironment {
	protected readonly environmentInputs = inject(NgtsEnvironmentInputs);

	@Input() set ground(ground: NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["ground"]) {
		this.environmentInputs.update({ ground });
	}

	@Input() set background(
		background: NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["background"],
	) {
		this.environmentInputs.update({ background });
	}

	@Input() set map(map: NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["map"]) {
		this.environmentInputs.update({ map });
	}

	@Input() set resolution(
		resolution: NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["resolution"],
	) {
		this.environmentInputs.update({ resolution });
	}

	@Input() set near(near: NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["near"]) {
		this.environmentInputs.update({ near });
	}

	@Input() set far(far: NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["far"]) {
		this.environmentInputs.update({ far });
	}

	@Input() set frames(frames: NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["frames"]) {
		this.environmentInputs.update({ frames });
	}
}
```

Here, we set up a `NgtsEnvironmentInputs` Service to store the Inputs' values. Naturally, we can use any data structure to store the values. In this example, we use [Angular Signals](https://angular.io/guide/signals).

We provide `NgtsEnvironmentInputs` service on `NgtsEnvironment` providers, so for every new instance of `NgtsEnvironment`, we'll have a new instance of `NgtsEnvironmentInputs`. Instead of duplicating the Inputs on `NgtsEnvironmentGround`, `NgtsEnvironmentMap`, and `NgtsEnvironmentCube`, these components can inject `NgtsEnvironmentInputs`
and use the `computed` values. With this change, `NgtsEnvironment` template now looks like the following:

```html
<ngts-environment-ground *ngIf="environmentInputs.ground();else noGround" />
<ng-template #noGround>
	<ngts-environment-map *ngIf="environmentInputs.map();else noMap" />
	<ng-template #noMap>
		<ngts-environment-cube />
	</ng-template>
</ng-template>
```

It is a lot cleaner! However, we do have a problem which is the default values for the Inputs. Each component can provide different default values for `NgtsEnvironmentInputsState`.
At first glance, we might be thinking of doing this

```ts
@Directive({
	/*...*/
})
export class NgtsEnvironmentMap {
	readonly #environmentInputs = inject(NgtsEnvironmentInputs);

	constructor() {
		this.#environmentInputs.set(defaultForEnvironmentMap);
	}
}
```

But this would not work because of how Angular resolves Inputs. Here's the over-simplified timeline:

- `<ngts-environment [map]="mapFromConsumer()" />` is used by the consumers and they provide some Inputs
- `NgtsEnvironment` is instantiated along with `NgtsEnvironmentInputs`
- `NgtsEnvironmentInputs` stores `map` value from `@Input() set map()`
- `NgtsEnvironment` renders `<ngts-environment-map [map]="environmentInputs.map()" />`
- `NgtsEnvironmentMap` is instantiated, and its `constructor` runs. Here, `NgtsEnvironmentInputs` updates `map` with `defaultForEnvironmentMap`, which is problematic.

We can work around this with two steps:

- Duplicate `map` Input on `NgtsEnvironmentMap` (similarly, we'll need to duplicate `background` Input on `NgtsEnvironmentCube`)
  > Which Input needs to be duplicated is varied on a case-by-case basis.
- Implement a `patch` method in our `NgtsEnvironmentInputs` service

```ts
@Injectable()
export class NgtsEnvironmentInputs {
	readonly #environmentInputs = signal<NgtsEnvironmentInputsState>({});

	/* code */

	/**
	 * A method to upsert a partial state. If a previous state exists, it will override the partial
	 */
	patch(partial: Partial<NgtsEnvironmentInputsState>) {
		this.#environmentInputs.update((previous) => ({
			...partial,
			...previous,
		}));
	}
}
```

Next, we can update `NgtsEnvironmentMap`

```ts
@Directive({
	/*...*/
})
export class NgtsEnvironmentMap {
	readonly #environmentInputs = inject(NgtsEnvironmentInputs);

	@Input() set map(map: NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["map"]) {
		this.#environmentInputs.update({ map });
	}

	constructor() {
		this.#environmentInputs.patch(defaultForEnvironmentMap);
	}
}
```

Finally, `NgtsEnvironment` template looks like

```html
<ngts-environment-ground *ngIf="environmentInputs.ground();else noGround" />
<ng-template #noGround>
	<ngts-environment-map
		*ngIf="environmentInputs.map();else noMap"
		[map]="environmentInputs.map()"
	/>
	<ng-template #noMap>
		<ngts-environment-cube [background]="environmentInputs.background()" />
	</ng-template>
</ng-template>
```

## Conclusion

**Inputs Service** is a pattern that can help with Component Composition when duplicating Inputs exist. It is a lot of code
than **Props Spreading,** but it does get the job done. In addition, **Inputs Service** can contain encapsulated logic related to the Components at hand
instead of just storing the Inputs values. I hope this blog post has been helpful to you. See you in the next one.

## (Bonus) Signal Inputs

In the near future, we will have **Signals Inputs,** which will change our approach a bit. Instead of a Service, we would have an Abstract Directive

```ts
@Directive()
export abstract class NgtsEnvironmentInputs {
    readonly map = input<NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["map"]>();
    readonly ground = input<NgtsEnvironmentInputsState["ground"]>();
    readonly background = input(false);
    readonly frames = input(Infinity);
    readonly near = input(1);
    readonly far = input(1000);
    readonly resolution = input(256);
}

@Component({
    /* same code */,
    providers: [{ provide: NgtsEnvironmentInputs, useExisting: NgtsEnvironment }]
})
export class NgtsEnvironment extends NgtsEnvironmentInputs {}
```
