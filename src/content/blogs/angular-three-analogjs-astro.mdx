## What is Astro?

[Astro](https://astro.build) is a high-performance framework designed to seamlessly merge the benefits of static and dynamic web development. It empowers developers to build modern websites using their preferred JavaScript frameworks while delivering lightning-fast loading times. With its unique "universal rendering" approach, Astro pre-renders pages into static HTML for optimal performance and security, while still enabling client-side interactivity. By leveraging partial hydration and other optimization techniques, Astro ensures efficient component loading and a superior user experience.

Recently, Astro has released [version 3](https://astro.build/blog/astro-3/) with tons of improvements. I figure this is good timing to write some content for Astro and [Angular](https://angular.io) since we're going to use Astro to render our Angular components.

## What is AnalogJS?

[Analog](https://analogjs.org/) is a fullstack meta-framework for building applications and websites with Angular. Additionally, Analog provides an [Astro Integration](https://analogjs.org/docs/packages/astro-angular/overview) that we can utilize to render Angular components in Astro.

## What is Angular Three?

[angular-three](https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three) is a custom [Angular Renderer](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2) to render [THREE.js](https://threejs.org) entities directly to the `HTMLCanvasElement` instead of the DOM.

## Create an Astro application

Getting started with Astro is super easy because they provide a CLI tool to create a new Astro application

Open up the terminal and enter the following command

```shell
npm create astro
```

Follow the prompts by `create-astro`. If you're wondering, here's mine

<BlogImage src={createAstro} alt="npm create astro prompts" />

## Add AnalogJS integration

To add AnalogJS integration to Astro, run the following command

```shell
npx astro add @analogjs/astro-angular
```

Say **Yes** to both questions and our Astro application is ready to render some Angular components

### Add `tsconfig.app.json`

Although we have added the Astro integration, we need to create a `tsconfig.app.json` at the project's root.

Start by creating `tsconfig.app.json`

```shell
touch tsconfig.app.json
```

Then fill it out with the following content

```json
{
    "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
    "compileOnSave": false,
    "compilerOptions": {
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "outDir": "./dist/out-tsc",
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
        "strict": true,
        "noImplicitOverride": true,
        "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
        "noImplicitReturns": true,
        "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
        "sourceMap": true,
        "declaration": false,
        "downlevelIteration": true,
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "importHelpers": true,
        "noEmit": false,
        "target": "es2022",
        "module": "es2022",
        "lib": ["es2022", "dom"],
        "skipLibCheck": true
    },
    "angularCompilerOptions": {
        "enableI18nLegacyMessageIdFormat": false,
        "strictInjectionParameters": true,
        "strictInputAccessModifiers": true,
        "strictTemplates": true,
        "allowJs": false
    },
    "files": [],
    "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

## Add our first Angular component

Create a new file, `Experience.ts`, in `src/components`

> You can use any file name for the component.

```shell
touch src/components/Experience.ts
```

Then fill it out with the following boilerplate

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
    standalone: true,
    template: `
        Hello Angular
    `,
})
export class Experience {}
```

> AnalogJS's Astro integration requires components to be `standalone: true`

To use this `Experience` component, open up `src/pages/index.astro`

Import `Experience` component

```diff
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
import Card from '../components/Card.astro';
+ import { Experience } from '../components/Experience';
```

Then render the component using the name of the component `<Experience />`

```diff
<h1>Welcome to <span class="text-gradient">Astro</span></h1>
<p class="instructions">
    To get started, open the directory <code>src/pages</code> in your project.<br
    />
    <strong>Code Challenge:</strong> Tweak the "Welcome to Astro" message above.
</p>

+ <Experience />

<ul role="list" class="link-card-grid">
    <!-- ... -->
</ul>
```

Start our Astro application's development server with the following command

```shell
npm run dev
```

Then go to `http://localhost:4321` and we'll see our `Experience` component is rendered ðŸŽŠ

<BlogImage
    src={astroHome}
    alt="Astro home page with Angular component rendered"
/>

> At this point, we can technically start writing blog posts with Astro and Angular

## Add Angular Three

Open up the terminal so we can install a few things

```shell
npm install angular-three@beta three three-stdlib
npm install -D @types/three
```

> We might need to run `npm install` with `--force` flag due to peer dependencies resolution

Let's go back to `Experience.ts` and add the following code

```ts
import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, Component } from "@angular/core";
import { NgtCanvas } from "angular-three";

@Component({
    standalone: true,
    template: ``,
    schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
class Scene {}

@Component({
    standalone: true,
    template: `
        <ngt-canvas [sceneGraph]="scene" />
    `,
    imports: [NgtCanvas],
})
export class Experience {
    scene = Scene;
}
```

> You can also break up `Scene` into a separate file

Since Three.js is a Canvas-base library (i.e: [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)), we want
to enable client-side JavaScript for our `Experience` component. Astro allows us to do so by using `client:load` directive on
our component. So, let's go back to `src/pages/index.astro` and make the following change

```diff
- <Experience />
+ <Experience client:load />
```

Additionally, we also need to update `astro.config.mjs` with the following change:

```diff
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [analogjsangular()],
+ vite: {
+   ssr: {
+     noExternal: ["angular-three", "three", "ngx-resize"],
+   },
+ },
});
```

> If you do not care about SSR, you can skip the config change and use `client:only` instead of `client:load`.
> This makes `Experience` component to only ever load on the client.

Make sure there is no error from our development server as well as in the browser's console. Now, we are ready to render some 3D objects

### Add our cube

Angular Three is a Custom Renderer. Hence, we need to _teach_ it how to render tags that we put on the template, like how Angular knows
how to render `<div>` into an `HTMLDivElement` on the DOM.

To do so, we'll use `extend()` API from `angular-three` to expand the internal **catalogue** of Angular Three

```diff
- import { NgtCanvas } from "angular-three";
+ import { NgtCanvas, extend } from "angular-three";
+ import { Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial, BoxGeometry } from "three";

+ extend({ Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial, BoxGeometry });
```

Here, we are _teaching_ Angular Three how to render a `THREE.Mesh`, a `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`, and a `THREE.BoxGeometry`

```diff
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
+    <ngt-mesh>
+      <ngt-box-geometry />
+      <ngt-mesh-basic-material color="hotpink" />
+    </ngt-mesh>
  `,
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
class Scene {}
```

Notice how we use `ngt-*` to render our 3D objects. `extend()` turns what we pass in into a **catalogue** of HTML Custom Element tags prefixed with `ngt-`
followed by the name of the entity in `kebab-case`. This is also the reason why we need `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`.

Now, our Astro application renders a pink "box"

<BlogImage src={astroBox} alt="Astro home page a pink box" />

### Increase the Canvas area

Our canvas is a little too small. This is because of two reasons:

-   Canvas default height is `150px` per [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html5-author-20120329/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element)
-   Our `Experience`'s parent element doesn't have a `height` set

`NgtCanvas` component is designed to take on the parent's dimensions. Hence, we can control our canvas' sizes by wrapping `<Experience />` with
a container with a specified `height`

```diff
+ <div style="height: 600px">
    <Experience client:load />
+ </div>
```

The canvas will take up `600px` and our pink box will be more visible.

<BlogImage
    src={astroBoxBig}
    alt="Astro home page a pink box on a large canvas"
/>

### Animate the box

To animate our box, we can use `(beforeRender)` output on `<ngt-mesh>`

```diff
- import { NgtCanvas, extend } from "angular-three";
+ import { NgtCanvas, extend, type NgtBeforeRenderEvent } from "angular-three";

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
-   <ngt-mesh>
+   <ngt-mesh (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($event)">
      <ngt-box-geometry />
      <ngt-mesh-basic-material color="hotpink" />
    </ngt-mesh>
  `,
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
class Scene {
+  onBeforeRender({ object, state }: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<THREE.Mesh>) {
+    object.rotation.x += state.delta;
+    object.rotation.y += state.delta;
+  }
}
```

`(beforeRender)` allows our objects to participate in the animation loop that Angular Three creates to render the Scene Graph.
This function runs outside of Angular Zone (i.e: outside of Angular Change Detection mechanism) to maintain high FPS. It is good practice
to **NOT** update states in this function.

-   The `state` object contains useful information about Angular Three internals like `delta`, `clock`, the default `THREE.Scene`, the default `THREE.Camera`, and more.
-   The `object` is the instance of the 3D object that Angular Three renders. In this case, it is the `THREE.Mesh` instance from `ngt-mesh`

<BlogImage src={astroBoxAnimate} alt="A rotating pink box" format="gif" />

### Let there be lights

At the moment, our "box" looks bland. In fact, we can't even tell if it's a box. The reason is we're using `MeshBasicMaterial`
for our box and `MeshBasicMaterial` does not reflect lights. Let's switch to `MeshStandardMaterial`, a material that can reflect lights.

```diff
- import { BoxGeometry, Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial } from "three";
+ import { BoxGeometry, Mesh, MeshStandardMaterial } from "three";

- extend({ Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial, BoxGeometry });
+ extend({ Mesh, MeshStandardMaterial, BoxGeometry });
```

Then we can update our template

```diff
<ngt-mesh (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($event)">
    <ngt-box-geometry />
-    <ngt-mesh-basic-material color="hotpink" />
+    <ngt-mesh-standard-material color="hotpink" />
</ngt-mesh>
```

But wait, our box is now pitch black.

<BlogImage src={astroBoxBlack} alt="A 'black' box" format="gif" />

We haven't added any lights yet. Imagine a dark room, there is no light that our box can reflect on. Let's add some lights

```diff
import {
+ AmbientLight,
  BoxGeometry,
+ DirectionalLight,
  Mesh,
  MeshStandardMaterial,
} from "three";

extend({
  Mesh,
  MeshStandardMaterial,
  BoxGeometry,
+ AmbientLight,
+ DirectionalLight,
});
```

Next, let's update our template to render those lights

```diff
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
+   <ngt-ambient-light [intensity]="Math.PI" />
+   <ngt-directional-light [intensity]="Math.PI" />

    <ngt-mesh (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($event)">
      <ngt-box-geometry />
      <ngt-mesh-standard-material color="hotpink" />
    </ngt-mesh>
  `,
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
class Scene {
+ Math = Math;

  onBeforeRender({ object, state }: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<THREE.Mesh>) {
    object.rotation.x += state.delta;
    object.rotation.y += state.delta;
  }
}
```

Voila! Now our box looks so much better, with dimensionality, like a real box.

<BlogImage
    src={astroBoxAnimateLights}
    alt="A 'real' rotating pink box"
    format="gif"
/>

### Take control of the camera

Who hasn't tried to "grab" the scene and rotate it around? Well, we can't with what we currently have because
our camera is **static**. However, we will be able to control our camera with the help of `OrbitControls`

Let's teach Angular Three how to render `OrbitControls`

```diff
+ import { OrbitControls } from "three-stdlib";

extend({
  Mesh,
  MeshStandardMaterial,
  BoxGeometry,
  AmbientLight,
  DirectionalLight,
+ OrbitControls,
});
```

Next, let's adjust our `Scene` component to render `OrbitControls`

```diff
import {
  NgtCanvas,
  extend,
  type NgtBeforeRenderEvent,
+ injectNgtStore,
+ NgtArgs,
} from "angular-three";

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <ngt-ambient-light [intensity]="Math.PI" />
    <ngt-directional-light [intensity]="Math.PI" />

    <ngt-mesh (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($event)">
      <ngt-box-geometry />
      <ngt-mesh-standard-material color="hotpink" />
    </ngt-mesh>

+   <ngt-orbit-controls *args="[camera(), domElement()]" />
  `,
+ imports: [NgtArgs],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
class Scene {
  Math = Math;

+ private store = injectNgtStore();
+ camera = this.store.select("camera");
+ domElement = this.store.select("gl", "domElement");

  onBeforeRender({ object, state }: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<THREE.Mesh>) {
    object.rotation.x += state.delta;
    object.rotation.y += state.delta;
  }
}
```

-   We import `injectNgtStore` and `NgtArgs` from `angular-three`
-   We add `NgtArgs` to `imports` array to make `*args` directive available to our template
-   We call `injectNgtStore` to grab the internal Angular Three store object via DI
    -   `camera` is the default camera. `this.store.select()` returns a [Signal](https://angular.io/guide/signals)
    -   `domElement` is the DOM element from the `WebGLRenderer`. `this.store.select()` accepts multiple arguments to select nested objects.
-   We render `ngt-orbit-controls` and pass `camera()` along with `domElement()` to `*args`
    -   This is equivalent to `new OrbitControls(camera, domElement)`

Back to our running application and BOOM ðŸ’¥, we can grab the scene, rotate it around, and zoom in/out

## Conclusion

Astro is truly a magnificient technology. It is light-weight, wicked fast, and easy to integrate with other frameworks.
On the other hand, I cannot praise AnalogJS enough for what it enables for Angular developers. In this blog post, we learn
how to use AnalogJS to bring Angular components to Astro land with an example of rendering a 3D box using Angular Three.

Give [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro), [AnalogJS](https://github.com/analogjs/analog), and [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
each a star if you haven't. I hope you have fun with all the technologies that we talk about in this blog post. See you in the next one.
