    <p class="text-lg mb-2">Hello world,</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        My name is Chau Tran. I am currently working as a
        <span class="font-bold text-primary">Sr. Engineer</span> at <a
            href="https://nrwl.io"
            rel="noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            class="text-primary underline cursor-pointer"

        This is the place that I use to share my knowledge about programming and
        personal stuffs. That said, the blog will focus on Web Technologies like
        <a
            href="https://angular.io"
            rel="noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            class="text-primary underline cursor-pointer"
        >
            Angular
        </a>,
        <a
            href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"
            rel="noreferrer"
            target="_blank"
            class="text-primary underline cursor-pointer"
        >
            TypeScript
        </a>
        , and other related technologies. Additionally, I also blog about random
        things like
        <span class="italic">
            "how I wipe my machine once every six months"
        </span>
        . This blog is powered by
        <a
            href="https://astro.build"
            rel="noreferrer"
            target="_blank"

        argue for, or maybe a smile) here on this blog. If you have any
        question, or absolutely anything at all, please do not hesitate to reach
        out to me on any of the social medium listed in the info box. See y'all
