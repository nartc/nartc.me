		This is the place that I use to share my knowledge about programming and
		personal stuffs. That said, the blog will focus on Web Technologies like

		<a

			rel="noreferrer"
			target="_blank"
			class="cursor-pointer text-primary underline"
		>
			Angular
		</a>,
		<a
			href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/"
			rel="noreferrer"
			target="_blank"
			class="cursor-pointer text-primary underline"
		>
			TypeScript
		</a>
		, and other related technologies. Additionally, I also blog about random
		things like
		<span class="italic">
			"how I wipe my machine once every six months"
		</span>
		. This blog is powered by

		argue for, or maybe a smile) here on this blog. If you have any
		question, or absolutely anything at all, please do not hesitate to reach
